# CLI Node App

The problem:

Create a command line application using Node.

The solution:

This application uses Axios to get data from several APIs. I can search for movie info from OMDB, returning name, release date, rating, country of origin, language, plot and cast. Concert info from Bands in Town will show name of venue, location and dates for the next 10 shows. Song info from Spotify gets name of artist, name of song, Spotify link to song (if available) and album name.

Since this is a CLI, please view the provided .png files in my repo to see functionality.

I used a .env file for password and API key security.
