This application should fullfill a variety of search criteria. 
Based on keywords, the user will be able to search for a song, concert dates, or movie information.
If the user prompts "spotify-this-song", they will recieve the title, artist, the album the song is from and a link to listen to the song on spotify.
If they propmt "concert-this" they will find upcoming conert dates, venues and locations.
A "movie-this" prompt will provide a lengthy list of movie information.
When you open the application in the terminal, type node liri and then one of the command lines followed by the appropriate search criteria.
