# liri-node-app

I had received instructions on how to fix part of my broken code. While attempting to resolve those issues, I broke the entire application. It is not functional at the moment. 

This application should fullfill a variety of search criteria. 
Based on keywords, the user will be able to search for a song, concert dates, or movie information.
If the user prompts "spotify-this-song", they will recieve the title, artist, the album the song is from and a link to listen to the song on spotify. If the user chooses nothing, "The Sign" by Ace of Base will return.
If they propmt "concert-this" they will find upcoming conert dates, venues and locations.
A "movie-this" prompt will provide a lengthy list of movie information. if the user chooses nothing, "Mr. Nobody" will return.
When you open the application in the terminal, type node liri and then one of the command lines followed by the appropriate search criteria.
I used axios, fs, spotify, and dotenv npms as well as the APIs for spotify, bandsintown and omdb.
The user should be able to input do-what-it-says and then the app will run text from a random.txt file. i am not yet able to complete this.
I did make it so that data would be stored to the log.txt but i did not set the correct values. 
Not an excuse, but i was on vacation last week and got a late start on this assignment.
I have included screenshots of the working command prompts with their outcomes. They are titled appropriately.
I was lead developer.

I fixed the number of concert dates that appear and i also fixed the data being sent to the log.txt file. I did this after the assignment was due but it was bugging me.
